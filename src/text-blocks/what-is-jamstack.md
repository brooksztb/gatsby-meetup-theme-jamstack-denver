## What is the JAMstack ?

It's Javascript, APIs, and Markup.

An explosive mix between "old-fashioned" static sites and recent technologies such as React and GraphQL which makes it possible to design super fast sites, super fast.

JAMstack relies on technologies like Gatsby, Contentful, Netlify and many others, and runs sites of all types and sizes:

ðŸ›¬ Landing pages: [Formidable Labs](https://formidable.com)

ðŸ“š The Documentation: [React](https://reactjs.org)

ðŸ’° E-commerce: [Flamingo](https://www.shopflamingo.com/)

Performance and SEO are issues handled by default, which gives you time to take care of what really matters: your site.
